### Setup Guide for MiYE

#### Prerequisite

2. Install PrettyTable
      `pip install prettytable`
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

#### Install Note

MiYE was developed incrementally using the agile software development methodology. At the end of every iteration, a tag is created to mark a stable version of the software, i.e. a potentially shippable product increment. The tags supported in MiYE are:
- v0.1
- v0.2
- v0.3
- v1.0 
- v1.0.1 
- v2.0 (latest stable release)

Starting with v0.3, MiYE will require authentication to be accessed. Each version of MiYE (prior to v1.0) is a breaking release and will require the user to reset their database.

#### Install MiYE via git
